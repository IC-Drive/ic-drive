## Current web2 alternatives are broken
- They are susceptible to many types of hacks
- They have backdoor access to user data
- Privacy invading algorithms

## How IC Drive ensures privacy
- We believe privacy is a fundamental right in the digital world
- Only a user has access to their data via the Internet Identity
- IC Drive as a platform don't have access to the user data and hence your data is fully secure
- No backdoor access and analysis of any user data
